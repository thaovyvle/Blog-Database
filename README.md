# MySQL Blog with Comments

For this project, I created a database using MySQL that performs basic queries and operations. These functions resemble the type of work done by routes in Express. The "postsBackup.json" file has the data in json format to see how these objects are represented.


# Specifications

## Table Schema

Posts:

```text
  title: string
  author: string
  date: DateTime
  postId: string
  content: string
```

Comments:

```text
  author: string
  date: DateTime 
  commentId: string
  postId: string
  content: string
```

## Routes

The application handles the following routes:

• GET /posts : Returns the array of posts.
• GET /posts/[author] : Returns an array of posts by a given author (assume author username is unique).
• GET /post/[postId]/ : Retrieves a single post object based on postId (not **_id**, which is generated by MongoDB)
• POST /post : Accepts a JSON object as the body of the request containing all post fields and saves to the database.
• DELETE /post/[postId] : Removes the post from the database based on the postId field.
• GET /post/[postId]/comments : Returns all comments associated with a given postId
• POST /post/[postId]/comment : Adds a comment to the end of the post and returns the commentId
• DELETE /post/[postId]/comment/[commentId] : Deletes the comment with the provided commentId on the post with the postId
