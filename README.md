# MongoDB Blog with Comments

For this project, I created a database using MongoDB that performs basic queries and operations. These functions resemble the type of work done by routes in Express. The "bookData_backup.json" file has the data in a json format to see how these objects are represented.


# Specifications

## Document Schema

Posts:

```text
title: string
author: string
date: DateTime
postId: string
comments: [{
  author: string
  date: DateTime
  commentId: string
  content: string
}]
content: string
```

## Routes

The application handles the following routes:

- GET /posts : Returns the array of posts.
- GET /posts/\[author\] : Returns an array of posts by a given author (assume author username is unique).
- GET /post/\[postId\]/ : Retrieves a single post object based on **postId** (not
  **\_id**, which is generated by MongoDB)
- POST /post : Accepts a JSON object as the body of the request containing all post
  fields and saves to the database.
- DELETE /post/\[postId\] : Removes the post from the database based on the **postId** field.
- POST /post/\[postId\]/comment : Adds a comment to the end of the post and returns the commentId
- GET /post/\[postId\]/comments : Returns all comments associated with a given postId
- DELETE /post/\[postId\]/comment/\[commentId\] : Deletes the comment with the provided **commentId** on the post with the **postId**
